# Common Map Geospatial Notation (CMGN)
The geospatial notation is a simple programming language independant set of interfaces representing geospatial concepts. CMGN  is intented to simplify sharing of geospatial data between systems, and programming languages by defining the minimal set of geospatill attributes that should be avaiable to a map to properly render a geospatial representation, while allowing the underlying object implmentint these interfaces to have other attributes and methods the map can ignore.

This is in a conceptual phase and will be formalized into a functional BETA project in the near future
